# Go API Server Just Returns your JSON.

For Japanese, see [日本語](/README_jp.md).  
Docker image [IMAGE](https://hub.docker.com/r/sota0113/jpi-server)  
just returns json object as an API server.  
Root directory is for health check and returns json "{status:up}".  
As default, "/dir" directory returns its IP addresses and os inforation with json format.

# USAGE
pull image `docker pull sota0113/jpi-server:go-1.11.5` or build the app with `docker build` command and run exposing container port 8080 to any host port.  
Using docker, run like `docker run ${THIS IMAGE} -p $PORT:8080`.  

When you access to container with directory "/dir", it returns json as default including ip address, hostname and OS type of running container.  
The return object is changeable. To configure your retrun, see next chapter `CRUD Operation`.
```
## Let's say, the application is running on localhost and listen port 3002 of localhost.
❯❯❯ curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3002/list
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:22:48 GMT
Content-Length: 77

{"ipaddress":["127.0.0.1,172.17.0.2"],"hostname":"cb0a02e8984d","os":"linux"}
```
Note, request end with "/" does not work.
```
❯❯❯ curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3002/list/
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:22:44 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```

Accessing container with curl as above leads to output logs to `stdout` as below.
```

# CRUD Operation
Return object of this application is changeable.  
`text/plain` and `application/json` is the usable Content-Type for now.  
The type of content is automatically distinguished.  

## GET
See first chapter `USAGE`. Execute GET request to the application.

If you operate GET request against unexist path, it would return 404.
```
❯❯❯ curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3002/list/api/v1/unExistContent
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Sun, 10 Mar 2019 13:35:36 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```

## POST
`POST` operation is not allowed. It would return 400.  
Same operation as `Upadte` for now. See chapter `Upadte` below. 

## PUT
To update return object, execute `PUT` request operation against a path `/list/api/v1/${CONTENTNAME}`.  
If your content is new one and created successfully, it would return 201.  
If your content already exists, meaning update your content, it would return 204.  
Here is an example.

```
## create new content.
❯❯❯ curl -i -X PUT localhost:3002/list/api/v1/newContent -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Hello World!"}'
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:31:57 GMT
Content-Length: 52

CONTENT UPDATED. Contetnt type is application/json.

## update content.
❯❯❯ curl -i -X PUT localhost:3002/list/api/v1/newContent -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "May the force be with you."}'
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:36:10 GMT
```

make sure ${CONTENTNAME} of your request path `/list/api/v1/${CONTENTNAME}` does not contain "/".  
If "/" is included in request path, it would return 409.
```
❯❯❯ curl -i -X PUT localhost:3002/list/api/v1/newContent/  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Hello World!"}'
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Date: Sun, 10 Mar 2019 15:53:41 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```

## Delete
To Delete your content, execute Delete request.  
If your opeartion succeeded, it would return 204.

```
❯❯❯ curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:3002/list/api/v1/newContent
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type:
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:39:08 GMT
```

Once your content is deleted, the endpoint returns 404.
```
❯❯❯ curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3002/list/api/v1/newContent
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type:
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:39:23 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```
