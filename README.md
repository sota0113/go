# Go Application for test on Container Services.

Root directory is for health check and returns json "{status:up}".
"/dir" directory returns its IP addresses and os inforation with json format as default.

# USAGE
build the app with `docker build` command, then run app with port 8080.
Using docker, run like `docker run ${THIS IMAGE} -p $PORT:8080`.

When you access to container with directory "/dir", it returns json as default including ip address, hostname and OS type of running container.
The return object is changeable. To configure your retrun, see next chapter `CRUD Operation`.
```
## Let's say, the application is running on localhost and listen port 30001 of localhost.
~ ❯❯❯ curl -i localhost:30001/dir
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: Application/json
Date: Wed, 06 Mar 2019 08:49:14 GMT
Content-Length: 77

{"ipaddress":["127.0.0.1,172.17.0.3"],"hostname":"57d7191cc011","os":"linux"}
```

Accessing container with curl as above leads to output logs to `stdout` as below.
```
